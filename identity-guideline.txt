## Voice: If your brand could talk, how would they speak? What sorts of things would they say? Would they speak with a folksy vernacular or a refined, erudite clip? Describe the specific aspects of your brands voice, and how it might change in various communication situations. People change their language and tone to fit the situation, and so should the voice of your brand.

## Copy Examples: Provide examples of the type of copy that might be used in different situations in your interface. This will help writers quickly get a sense for how your design persona should communicate.

## Visual Lexicon (optional): If you are a designer creating this document for yourself and/or a design team, you can include in your design persona a visual lexicon providing an overview of the colors, typography, and visual style that will best convey the personality of your brand visually. You can either be general about these concepts, or go so far as to include something like a mood board.

## Engagement Methods: Describe the types of emotional engagement methods you might use in your interface to support the design persona, and create a memorable experience.
